            Though small and seemingly insignificant, bees play a crucial roll in the reproductive cycles of many
            plants that provide us with a majority of the food that we eat today. Albert Einstein once said that â€œIf
            the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left". Love
            fruits, veggetables, and nuts? Save a bee.

                Bees have an open circulatory system which makes them extremely sensitive to toxic particles in the air
                causing disorientation, stunting growth ultimately leading to death.

                While bee hives provide a home and safe place to raise their young, they are packed into such a small
                and confined space creating a breeding ground for disease and parasites.

            <p>
                Many companies will only rent bee hives for a season which require 100 of colonies to be transported
                far distances. Entire colonies are lost in the process.
